# Signal recovery with with un-trained convolutional neural networks


This repository provides code for reproducing the figures in the  paper:

**``Signal recovery with with un-trained convolutional neural networks
''**

## Installation and dependencies

The code is written in python and relies on pytorch. The following libraries are required: 
- python 3
- pytorch
- numpy
- skimage
- matplotlib
- scikit-image
- jupyter

The libraries can be installed via:
```
conda install jupyter
```
